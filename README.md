# Natsuki_Subaru
Simple Discord bot that is customized to represent Natsuki Subaru from Re: Zero

There is a file that is missing called auth.json. Inside the file:
{ 
   "token": "<Bot token>" 
}

To obtain a bot token, you'll need obtain one from Discord's developer port.
From here, you'll need create auth.json if you wish to run this bot.
